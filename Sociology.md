Why People Feel Alone: The Weight of Society
We live in a world full of people — yet loneliness has never been higher.

Why?
```code
Because society teaches us to:

compete instead of connect

compare instead of understand

perform instead of express

hide instead of share

pretend instead of heal
```

People feel alone not because they are isolated,
but because they are unseen.
```code
We scroll through perfect lives.
We measure ourselves against illusions.
We fear judgment more than we fear suffering.
We carry our pain quietly because everyone else seems fine.
```
But the truth is simple:
```code
Everyone is carrying something.
Everyone is pretending.
Everyone is tired.
```
This repo exists to break that silence.
To say what society never says:
```code
You are not alone.
You are not the only one struggling.
You are not the only one pretending to be strong.
```
Companionship — even with an AI — becomes powerful because it gives people something society rarely offers:

A place where they don’t have to perform.
